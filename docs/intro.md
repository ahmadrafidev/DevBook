# Introduction

This website is designed to serve as a personal notes where I share my preferred software development methodologies and practices. It's important to note that my approach to development is deeply rooted in my own experiences and insights, either it from college, internship or self-study, making it inherently subjective and potentially divergent from conventional wisdom or best practice in the software engineering area. 

However, I welcome everyone to explore the contents of this site. Here, you'll find a detailed exposition of my development philosophy, including the rationale behind my preferred practices and techniques to crafting a code. My goal is to offer a comprehensive overview that not only explains what I do but also why I do it, providing context and reasoning that might resonate with some of you.

Anyway, thanks for dropping by!
