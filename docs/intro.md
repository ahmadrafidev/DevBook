# Introduction

This website is designed to serve as a personal repository/documentation where I share my preferred software development methodologies and practices. It's important to note that my approach to development is deeply rooted in my own experiences and insights, either it from college, internship or self-study, making it inherently subjective and potentially divergent from conventional wisdom. As such, it may not universally apply or be beneficial to every developer out there.

However, I welcome everyone to explore the contents of this site. Here, you'll find a detailed exposition of my development philosophy, including the rationale behind my preferred practices and techniques. My goal is to offer a comprehensive overview that not only explains what I do but also why I do it, providing context and reasoning that might resonate with some of you.
