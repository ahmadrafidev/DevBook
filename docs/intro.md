# Introduction

Hello! Hola! Bonjour! こんにちは! नमस्ते! 안녕하세요! Hallo! 👋

Welcome to DevBook!

This website is a living site where I use as my personal notes where I share my preferred software development methodologies and practices. These reflections are deeply personal and mostly based on my own experiences from college, internships, and self-study, making it subjective and possibly different from conventional wisdom-but that’s what makes them unique!.

Feel free to explore the contents, where I explain in detail my development philosophy and the reasoning behind my practices and techniques. My goal is to explain not just what I do, but why I do it, providing context that might resonate with you.

Thanks for dropping by!

Let's connect with me through [X](https://x.com/rafiwiranaa)!
