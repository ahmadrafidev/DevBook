# Introduction

This website serves as my personal notes where I share my preferred software development methodologies and practices. My approach is based on my own experiences from college, internships, and self-study, making it subjective and possibly different from conventional wisdom.

Feel free to explore the contents, where I detail my development philosophy and the reasoning behind my practices and techniques. My goal is to explain not just what I do, but why I do it, providing context that might resonate with you.

Thanks for dropping by!
