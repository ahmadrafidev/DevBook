# Design Engineering

The intersection between product engineering + product design.

What I mean product engineering is about building the best software, web, and mobile applications using the most effective and efficient practices. It involves every technical aspect of development, from writing clean, maintainable code to ensuring the product is scalable and performs well. Product engineers focus on creating robust, high-quality solutions that solve real problems, encompassing software engineering, web engineering, and mobile engineering. They follow industry best practices, optimize performance, and emphasize technical excellence, including code quality, testing, and continuous integration/deployment.

Then, what I mean product design is the art and science of creating a product that offers an exceptional user experience. It includes understanding user needs, designing intuitive interfaces, and ensuring the product is accessible and enjoyable to use. Even while focusing on engineering excellence, the user experience remains the north star. Product design covers user experience (UX), user interface (UI), usability, aesthetics, user-centered design, and accessibility, aiming to create a product that is easy to use, visually engaging, and meets user needs effectively.
