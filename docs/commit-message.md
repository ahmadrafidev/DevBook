# Commit Message

Here's my take about **Commit Message**.

## Philosophy

1. **One Liner**: A one-liner commit message advocates for simplicity and can ensure that the purpose of the commit can be quickly grasped at a glance.
2. **Concise**: Commit message should be very concise and clear so that others developer can quickly understand what this commit is about. A concise commit message provides enough information to convey the purpose clearly without unnecessary details.

## Use Cases

For commit message in side projects or personal projects, 
I usually go to with this site: [Commit Message Conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), because it offers a standards message that are easy to use and easy to understand for most developers that I used to work with. Next, in cases when I work in an organization or company, such as when I was an intern, of course I follow the commit message rules that apply in the place where I work. For example, there is a commit message that is related to a Jira ticket or task that I am working on, then added with a commit message from [conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Additionally, I usually also apply limits in my commit messages, such as a commit message limit of 40-50 characters. I do this so I can implement concise commit messages.

## Nice to have

Below is a package that is quite helpful for me to standardizing commit messages on a software project:
1. [Commit Lint](https://commitlint.js.org/)
