# Commit Message

Here's my discovery about **Commit Message**.

## Philosophy

1. One liner commit message
2. Concise

## My Commit Message Use Case

For commit message in side project or personal project, 
I usually go to with this site: [Commit Message Conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), 
because it offers a standards message that are easy to use and easy to understand for most developers that I used to work with.
Next, in cases when I work in an organization or company, such as when I was an intern, of course I follow the commit message
rules that apply in the place where I work. For example, there is a commit message that is tailored to the Jira ticket or task that I am doing, then added with a commit message from [conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This method is done so that anyone reviewing my code knows what task I am working on and it is easy to review it, and when someone reads my code in the future, they will know the meaning behind the code that I created.
