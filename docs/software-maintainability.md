# Software Maintainability

Here's my perspective about **Software Maintainability**.

## Refactoring
One of my ways to do refactoring is based on this website: [refactoring guru](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/techniques) and usually the reason I do refactoring is because I want my codebase is free from [code smells](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells) that can be burden in the future of my team just like a [technical debt](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/technical-debt).

## Design Pattern
For design pattern, I'm all in with this [holy grail](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).

## Documentation
I am referencing to this [documentation docs](documentation.md).

## Testing
[Testing docs](testing.md).

## Deployment
[Deployment docs](deployment.md).

## Modularity
[Microservices docs](microservices.md).

## Scalability
[Scalability docs](scale.md).

## Security
