# Technical Documentation

Technical Docs or usually often abbreviated as a Tech Docs is documentation that includes all details regarding a software or system. All my learnings about making tech docs before starting coding implementation can usually be referenced from this website [Design Doc](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-doc-a-design-doc/). In my opinion, the sections of a tech docs from that website are sufficient and can cover many things regarding the creation of software or systems. In addition to those links, I think this resources also provides a great outline of best practices for creating tech doc:
1. [Design Docs at Google](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/).
2. [Eng Design Doc Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WMG_gt67eW9RYl33R02KEv2RxFvuMldg1s_TcM0Sn2M/edit#heading=h.psi98t855m9r)
