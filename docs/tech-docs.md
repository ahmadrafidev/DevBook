# Technical Documentation

## Tech Doc
Technical Doc or usually often abbreviated as a Tech doc is documentation that includes all details regarding a software or system.
All my learnings about making tech docs before starting coding can usually be referenced from this website [Design Doc at Google](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-doc-a-design-doc/). In my opinion, the sections of a tech docs from that website are sufficient and can cover many things regarding the creation of software or systems.
