# Technical Documentation

Technical Doc or usually often abbreviated as a Tech doc is documentation that includes all details regarding a software or system. All my learnings about making tech docs before starting coding implementation can usually be referenced from this website [Design Doc](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-doc-a-design-doc/). In my opinion, the sections of a tech docs from that website are sufficient and can cover many things regarding the creation of software or systems. In addition to those links, I think this resource also makes a point about why creating tech doc
is a best practice [Design Docs at Google](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/).
