# Technical Documentation

Technical Documentation, often abbreviated as Tech Docs, is crucial documentation that encompasses all details regarding a software or system. These documents are vital for guiding development, ensuring consistency across teams, and aiding in maintenance. 

From my experiences, especially during college where I experienced it myself creating software from scratch, before starting any coding implementation, referring to well-structured tech docs is essential for software development. One excellent resource I consistently use is [Design Doc](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-doc-a-design-doc/), which outlines necessary sections and considerations for creating robust software or systems.

In addition to the above, here are some resources that provide a comprehensive outline of best practices for creating tech docs:

1. [Design Docs at Google](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/): It offers insights into the methodologies used by one of the tech industry's leaders. This guide emphasizes clarity, thoroughness, and accessibility in documentation.
2. [Eng Design Doc Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WMG_gt67eW9RYl33R02KEv2RxFvuMldg1s_TcM0Sn2M/edit#heading=h.psi98t855m9r): A simple yet practical template that can be directly applied or adapted to suit specific project needs. Itâ€™s particularly useful for ensuring all critical aspects of a project are covered.

Through my journey, I've learned that effective tech docs are not just about detailing what needs to be built but also why. This approach ensures that everyone involved has a clear understanding and keeps the project aligned with its goals.
