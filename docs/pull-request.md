# Pull Request

## Behind the Scenes

A wise man said, 'time is the most valuable thing.' As a software engineer, Iâ€™ve always valued time, especially when contributing to projects via Pull Requests (PR) or Merge Requests (MR). Each PR must address the issue precisely without causing disruptive changes on the main/master branch. I ensure that every modification is explained clearly and concisely to save the reviewer's time and maintain project integrity and quality.

## A bit of a tips!

For me, good PR criteria are as follows:

1. Add tests
2. Keep it small
3. Maintain consistency
4. Ensure readability
5. Optimize performance
6. Automate
