# Monitoring and Logging

Here's my take about **Monitoring and Logging** and why monitoring and logging are crucial components of managing any modern IT infrastructure.

## The Bird's Eye
 At a high level, monitoring provides a bird's eye view of my systems' health and performance. It's like having a constant surveillance system that ensures everything runs smoothly and efficiently. Monitoring tools alert you to any performance degradation or system failures, allowing for proactive management and troubleshooting.

## The Note Taker
Logging, on the other hand, is the meticulous note-taker of the digital world. It records every event, transaction, and interaction that occurs within your systems. These logs are invaluable for diagnosing problems, understanding user behavior, and ensuring security compliance. Together, monitoring and logging provide a comprehensive overview of your systems, enabling informed decision-making and efficient problem-solving.

## What to Monitor and Logging
When it comes to what you should be monitoring and logging, focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) that are critical to your business operations. This includes system health metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, network performance, and application response times. Log everything that can help you troubleshoot issues or understand the security landscape, including access logs, transaction logs, and system events.
