# Documentation

Here is my perspective on **Documentation** as documentation plays an important role in software engineering, because it offers a foundation for understanding the software project as a whole for many stakeholders.

## Docs as a Code (DAAC)

Document as Code (DAAC) treats documentation with the same level of seriousness as code. This meaning involves managing documents through version control and meeting documentation standards for consistency. Document as Code includes collaboration, automation, and consistent documentation practices that can ensure documents are up-to-date, correct, and easily accessible to all developers on the team.

## Effective Documentation Tools From My Experience

Below are many of the tools that I have used to carry out documentation as far as my experiences goes. \
(note: order is not important)

1. [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)
   1. Reason: It integrates smoothly with other Atlassian products and offering a cohesive development workflow experience.
2. [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)
   1. Reason: Its simplicity and effectiveness for collaborative editing, sharing, and gathering feedback.
3. [Github Wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis)
   1. Reason: It provides a structured way to organize documentation, with each repository hosting its own documentation, thereby enhancing accessibility and organization.
4. [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)
   1. Reason: For me, Notion is favored for its customizable templates, straightforward interface, and robust third-party integration capabilities.
5. [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)
   1. Reason: Specifically designed for open-source software documentation, it features an easy-to-navigate standard template.
