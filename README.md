# My Journey in Learning Software Engineering - ahmadrafidev

Welcome to "My Learning" website, a digital space created by me to document and share a lifelong learning journey, especially in Software Engineeering area. This website serves as a unique, document-like platform where I, Rafi, continuously compile, reflect on, and share the knowledge and skills I acquire throughout my journey in Software Engineering area, either it from internship, mentorship, college, or self-study.

### **Purpose:**
The primary goal of this website is to embrace the concept of lifelong learning and learning in public. It's a place where I can track my progress, consolidate learning materials, and articulate insights gained from various experiences. By making this learning process public, I hope to inspire others to pursue their interests and commit to never-ending self-improvement, whatever it is your passion. <3

### **Structure:**
